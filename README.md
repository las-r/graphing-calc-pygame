# Graphing Calculator
A simple graphing calculator made in Python using Pygame.

# Usage
## Settings
- `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` change the width and height of the window, respectively.
- `RATE` changes the rate at which points are put on the graph. Higher numbers mean more points.
- `SIZE` changes size of the graph itself.
- `BGCOL`, `GRIDCOL`, `AXESCOL`, and `FCOL` each change the color of the background, grid, axes, and function, respectively.
## Function
Changing the function to graph is very easy. Just change the return value in terms of x in `f(x)`.
